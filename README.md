## Introduction 

FormFit is an exercise assistant Progressive-Web-App that provides feedback on different exercises. After creating an account, a user can get feedback on either a Squat, Push-Up, or Sit-Up. The feedback provided is based on calculations of different joints in real time as the user does their exercise of choice. A user can then check their history and see that history charted on the dashboard. If they are persistent enough and lucky they might find themselves on the global leaderboard!

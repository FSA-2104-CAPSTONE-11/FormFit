## Introduction 

FormFit is a digital fitness coach that analyses your form in real-time, assessing alignment and range of motion while exercising. The app gives you a score on squats, push-ups, or sit-ups. The feedback provided is based on calculations of different joints as you exercise. Summary statistics for each repetition are displayed upon completion of a session. Your history will be preserved to view during later visits and your performance data will displayed on the home dashboard in a visually pleasing display. If you are persistent enough, you might find yourself on the global leaderboard, which shows the top 10 point-earners throughout the app!
